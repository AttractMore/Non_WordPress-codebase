IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/forms";

/*********************
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.

@import "breakpoints/base";
@import "partials/header";
@import "partials/nav";

/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
@media print {

	// styles in print.scss
	@import "partials/print";
